git checkout

The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch. 
Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, 
and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch. 
Think of it as a way to select which line of development youÅfre working on.

In the previous module, we saw how git checkout can be used to view old commits.
Checking out branches is similar in that the working directory is updated to match the selected branch/revision; 
however, new changes are saved in the project history?that is, itÅfs not a read-only operation.
